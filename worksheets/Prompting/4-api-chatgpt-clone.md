## Setup & Infrastructure

### [ ] **[Easy]** Project Initialization
- [ ] Set up a new Vite project with React and TypeScript
- [ ] Configure the project to use Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Initialize Git and commit the basic project structure

### [ ] **[Medium]** API Key & Environment Setup
- [ ] Create a `.env` file to securely store API keys and other secrets
- [ ] Document instructions in the README on how to configure environment variables
- [ ] Ensure that the API key is never exposed in the client-side code (even though this is a frontend-only app, plan for secure handling of any sensitive info)

## Core Features

### [ ] **[Medium]** Real-time Text Chat Interface
- [ ] Create a `ChatWindow` component to display the conversation between the user and the ChatGPT clone
- [ ] Implement a text input component for user messages, triggering events on enter key press or button click
- [ ] Set up state management (using React hooks) to handle incoming and outgoing messages in real time
- [ ] (Technical Note: Consider using useState for messages and useEffect to simulate asynchronous responses)

### [ ] **[Medium]** Model Selection Interface
- [ ] Develop a `ModelSelector` component that displays available models
- [ ] Allow the user to select a model before starting the chat
- [ ] Implement a 'thinking' indicator (e.g., a spinner or loading text) to show when the model is processing a request

### [ ] **[Medium]** Session History with Local Storage
- [ ] Implement functions to save chat sessions to the browser's local storage
- [ ] On app load, retrieve and load previous session history if available
- [ ] Create a `SessionHistoryViewer` component to display past chats
- [ ] Ensure that starting a new chat does not overwrite existing session data unless explicitly intended

## UI/UX

### [ ] **[Easy]** Basic Layout & Responsive Design
- [ ] Build a responsive layout that works well on both desktop and mobile devices
- [ ] Create a header/navbar that includes the project title and navigation options (if needed)
- [ ] Use Tailwind CSS classes for layout adjustments and responsiveness

### [ ] **[Medium]** Component Styling & Animations
- [ ] Style the `ChatWindow`, `ModelSelector`, and `SessionHistoryViewer` components to maintain a minimalist design
- [ ] Differentiate between user messages and bot responses (colors, alignment, etc.)
- [ ] Add subtle animations for message transitions and loading states to enhance user experience

## Testing

### [ ] **[Easy]** Unit & Component Testing
- [ ] Write tests for individual components (e.g., `ChatWindow`, `ModelSelector`, and `SessionHistoryViewer`) to ensure they render correctly
- [ ] Validate that the text input accepts and displays user messages

### [ ] **[Medium]** End-to-End User Flow Testing
- [ ] Simulate user flows: starting a new chat, selecting a model, sending messages, and viewing session history
- [ ] Test local storage persistence by simulating page reloads and verifying that previous chats are loaded

## Deployment

### [ ] **[Easy]** Build & Deploy the Application
- [ ] Run the Vite build process to generate production-ready assets
- [ ] Deploy the application to a static hosting provider (e.g., Netlify or Vercel)
- [ ] Verify that environment configurations (like the API key in development) are correctly handled and not exposed in production
