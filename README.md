# VIBE Coding Workshop

Welcome to the VIBE Coding Workshop companion repository! This is your reference guide for building software with AI, designed for non-technical creators who want to turn their ideas into reality.

## What is VIBE Coding?

VIBE Coding (or "vibing with code") is a new approach to software development where you use AI tools to build websites, apps, and software without needing traditional programming knowledge. Instead of writing code line by line, you describe what you want to build, and AI tools help you create it.

## Workshop Goals

This workshop will help you:

- **Experience AI-powered development** - Learn how to use tools like Lovable and Bolt to build software
- **Turn ideas into software** - Transform concepts in your head into working applications
- **Build with confidence** - Create tools for personal use or business ideas
- **Understand the basics** - Get familiar with essential concepts like Git and project management
- **Start your journey** - Gain the foundation to continue building after the workshop

## Who This Is For

This workshop is designed for **non-technical people** who:

- Have ideas they want to build
- Are curious about how software is made
- Want to create tools for themselves or their business
- Don't have programming experience (and don't need it!)
- Are excited to experiment and learn

## How to Use This Repository

This repository contains worksheets and guides you can reference during and after the workshop:

### Worksheets

- **[Beginner Guide to Git](worksheets/beginner-guide-to-git.md)** - Understanding version control basics for your projects

### During the Workshop

Use these materials as quick references when you need a reminder about concepts we've covered.

### After the Workshop

Come back to these guides whenever you're working on your projects and need to refresh your memory. They're designed to be practical references, not textbooks!

## Tools We'll Use

- **Lovable** - AI-powered web development tool
- **Bolt** - AI coding assistant
- **Git/GitHub** - Version control to track your project's progress
- **Claude Code** - AI assistant for coding tasks

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have a GitHub account
2. Connect your AI tools (Lovable, Bolt) to GitHub
3. Start building and experimenting!
4. Reference these guides whenever you need them

## Questions?

Remember: there are no "dumb questions" in VIBE coding. If something doesn't make sense, ask! The whole point is to make software development accessible to everyone.

**Happy building!** The best way to learn is to start creating. Pick an idea and start vibing with it.
